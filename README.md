Determining the possible population affected for floodplains in the north of Colombia.

Colombia is a country of South America with a tropical weather. In Colombia is there no the stations, instead that there are normally two seasons of summer and winter each one, in a year. In the winter only there are rains (is there no snow). In the year 2017 Colombia was called the rainiest country in the world, with an average rainfall of 3,240 millimeters of rain each year. Further in Colombia there are many rivers and streams with high flows, and many peoples located their homes very near to the rivers and streams. For this in Colombia during the seasons of rains occur floods that affect many population, destroy homes and lives are lost.
This project proposes determine the possible population affected for the floodplains in the north of Colombia for the year 2020, region with high rainfall and many plains. There are basically two types of floods, one by the grow of the rains and streams, and other by runoff, the first is the most devastating and will be the situation that I will analyze.

I expect that obtain an amount of population affected of a least 30.000 persons.

This project I did it for the course GIS of UC Davis on Coursera.
